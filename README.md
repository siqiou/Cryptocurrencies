## Purpose of Analysis
This assignment is to test knowledge in the Unsupervised machine learning module: process data, clustering data, reduce dimensions, reduce the principal components using PCA, and create hvplot for data visualization.

Grouping the cryptocurrency clusters, and showing the total coins mined vs. total coins supply by Coin Names could help preparing the customer to get into the cryptocurrency market.
